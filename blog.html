                  Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                  First of all, the differences are pretty straight forword as
                  the name suggested, the localStorage is something in local and
                  the session expires when the session ends. Let's have a deeper
                  dive,The most significant difference between sessionStorage
                  and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire,
                  whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session
                  ends.A unique page session gets created once a document is
                  loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one
                  tab at a time. On the contrary, in localStorage you browse
                  through different window the localStorage remains same and
                  dosen't disapear like the sessionStorage until you clear it.
                  Lastly, the both have similar operations like
                  getItem(),setItem(),removeItem(),clear() these but again
                  localStorage has few more rooms than the session storage where
                  localStorage can store up to 10mb meanwhile session storage
                  stores only half of the local storage.

                  Difference between global scope and block scope?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Firstly, as the name stated global scope is something that can
                  be accessed from the whole globe. Let's understand is in a
                  programming way, When any js script runs there is a global
                  object named window, so everything will be in its scope and
                  reffered to global scope. Now when you declare and assign a
                  variable in a script file it stored as the window objects
                  property which later can be easily accissible from any where
                  of that window objects scope.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                  On the contrary, block scope is something which will only work
                  inside the block. Suppose you write an if-else statement and
                  inside the {} blocks you declare a variable using let or
                  const,you can only access that variable inside that scope, but
                  inside that scope if you want you can access the global
                  variable you declared.

                  How javaScript event loop works?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                  We all know js is a single threaded high level programming
                  language.Sometimes it needs to do some work in parallel such
                  as data fetching from the api or any function that needs time
                  to execute,otherwise the user experice will be horrified
                  because users need to wait a longer period as well as some
                  portion of the website will be broken as well. But how js
                  acheive this phenomenol achievement where it can work
                  simultenously? The simple answer to this question is event
                  loop.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Let's break it down, when a scripts runs on chrome for an
                  instance, it goes to the v8 engine first,when the v8 engine or
                  the call stack inside it see's the fetch method for an
                  instance it recognise its not included in his code, so
                  immidietly it goes to the browser api, from there it goes to
                  callback queue. Now event loop see if in the call stack no
                  synchronous code to execute it sends the asynchronous
                  functions to the call stack for the final execution.This is
                  the event loops work if nothing on call stach it sends the
                  async code to execute.

                  How many ways we get undefined in js?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                  We got undefined in js in 8 ways and they are: 1.If we declare
                  a variable and don't set the value then upon execution it will
                  give us undefined. 2.If a function dosen't return anything
                  then upon execution it will give us undefined. 3.You use a
                  return keyword in a function but not specified what you want
                  to return then upon execution it will give us undefined. 4.In
                  a function you use a number of paremeters but when you invoke
                  that function you only send a few parameters on none. so the
                  parameters inside that function will not get therir desire
                  values and will return an undefined. 5. If a non-existing
                  object property tried to be accessed it will give an
                  undefined. 6.If a non-existing array element tried to be
                  accessed it will give an undefined. 7. It you delete an array
                  elemnt using delete keyword than later try to access it it
                  will through an undefined. 8. If you directly assign a
                  variable undefined.
